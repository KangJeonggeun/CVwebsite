## **About the Project:**
I developed my website to showcase my resume and education. Throughout the project, I learned fundamental and practical skills in modern web development. I worked on the German translation using React-i18next. Additionally, I implemented an email sending service with Nodemailer. I developed the Next.js application and deployed it through Vercel. This experience has broadened my understanding of web development. For the design and basic structure, I utilized code from templates and worked under an MIT license.
